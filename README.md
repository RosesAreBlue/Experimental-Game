The idea is that the first to build to the opponent's side first wins. If any blocks are not indirectly connected to the top or bottom of the screen by adjacent blocks, they are destroyed You destroy blocks by firing balls which ricochet where each time a block is hit, it's "health" decreases until it is destroyed at 0.

Originally, I had hoped the game to achieve "easy-to-learn, but hard to master" status with lots of strategies diverging off of simpler strategies. However, very few strategies dominated and allowed for easy winning. A variant of this same idea could work better.
